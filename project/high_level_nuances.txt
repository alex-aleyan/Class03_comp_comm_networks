Client needs to:
  Get file's source /<path>/<filename>
  Get file's destination /<path>/<filename>
  Create file_id (24-bit id=yy[8],mm[4],dd[5],ss[6],us[1]) per file transfer.
  

Initiation Header needs to have:
  file name tag,
  destination /<path>/<filename>
  number of text lines to transfer for current file

State1: Server awaits a connection request and init packet.

State2: Client sends init packet to Server:
    file_id[16]: {yy[8]+mm[4]+dd[5] , ss[6]} = {date[10],ss[6]}  per file transfer.
    lines[16]:    number of text lines to be transmitted.
    payload_size[16]:current payload size.

    tx_ordered[1]:
        1-send burst of packets each packet containing a single line; 
        0-wait for acks from Servers used by server to request a line.

    reserved[15]
    payload: full path to file as the payload.

State3: Server received the init packet:
    Server registers file_id
    Server registers tx_ordered (only tx_ordered 0 is implemented for now)
    Server responds with the same packet
