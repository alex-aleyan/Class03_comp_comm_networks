Intra-Vehicular Network Survey Paper (iluminating wires)

1. Good choice of papers/sources (at least 6 IEEE Conferences and IEEE Journals; 
   IEEE spectrum cannot be used as a source but a good starting point)
2. Is the abstract engaging.
3. How well are ideas of the papers integrated together into your single paper.

Pointers:
Get as much info as possible and condense it down to a 10 page paper
11 point Time New Roman font; Single Column Format; 1.5 line spacing; 1 column format
IEEE Structure: Title, Abstract, Intro, Discussion & Results, Conclusion, References.
How to write a survey paper:
    Start with appropriate Title ()
    Abstract: tells you what the idea the paper discusses and the significant discoveries
    Intro: introduces the problem what trying to solve and brief outline of literature; discusses 
           advantages/disadvantages of certain puns? Eplain the sections
    Conclusion

Do NOT summarize papers one by one.
Avoid marginal papers.
Start identifying summinal papers in the area (they are referenced by other papers)
Once get 6-7 mainstream papers, you got a start.
Read thru Abstract, Intro and Conlusion to judge the paper  before reading it.
Try to understand the central idea of every paper before starting to write.
Try to write each section per idea comparing and contrasting ideas; try to find similarities and so on.
Provide citations to the figures in the captions!
